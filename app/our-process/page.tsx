                    <p>Each groom requires a combination of two things: a pet&apos;s needs, and their human&apos;s aesthetic preferences. Merging these two goals is facilitated by excellent communication between our staff and our clients. Pictures of the style of grooming you want are always a helpful guide for our groomers. These pictures can even be sent via our Moego booking app to ensure that we book you with the groomer who is best suited for your grooming needs.</p>

                    <p>We use all natural, high quality shampoos and conditioners. Every dog has their own skin and coat needs. Some dogs may have flakey or dry skin. Some dog breeds like Cocker Spaniels can be prone to skin infections like yeast and bacteria. We offer an array of different types of shampoo to hydrate, medicate, and clarify your pet&apos;s skin and coat. We offer a variety of products that help your dog&apos;s skin and coat stay clean, fresh, and pest free!</p>

                    <h2 className="text-2xl">Grooming Time:</h2>
                    <p>Some grooms take longer than others. We ask that you be prepared to have your dogs at our grooming salon for at least 1.5-3 hours for baths and 2-4 hours for haircuts. Some small breeds such as shih tzus and yorkies usually take around 2 hours while large doodles and other types of long-hair breeds can take 3-5 hours. While it&apos;s rare that a dog will take longer than 4 hours there are pets who may require that extra time to complete their grooms. We try to be as precise as we can when giving time estimates and we ask that you remain patient with our groomers when your pet is in our care. We value quality over quantity and do not wish to add stress to our groomers or our furry clients by rushing grooming services.</p>
